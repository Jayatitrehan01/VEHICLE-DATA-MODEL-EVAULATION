# VEHICLE-DATA-MODEL-EVAULATION
# About The Data
This dataset contains detailed listings of vehicles, capturing attributes such as make, model, engine type, fuel, price, transmission, and drivetrain (our target variable).

# Feature Description
* name: Full vehicle name (make, model, trim).
* description: Key features or highlights of the vehicle
* make,model: Brand and model of the vehicle
* year: Manufacturing year
* price: Price in USD
* engine: Engine Specification
* cylinders: Number of engine cylinders
* fuel: Fuel type (Gasoline, Diesel, Electric, etc.)
* mileage: Vehicle mileage
* transmission: Transmission type
* body: Body style (SUV, Sedan, Pickup Truck, etc)
* trim: Vehicle variant
* doors: Number of doors,
* exterior_color, exterior_color: vehicle color
* drivetrain: Target variable : type of drivetrain (e.g., All-wheel Drive).

# Project Summary
#Steps Performed:
1) Data Cleaning: Dropped irrelevant columns (name, description) and filled missing values.

2) Type Conversion: Corrected datatypes for numerical analysis and modeling.

3) Label Encoding: Encoded categorical variables for model compatibility.

4) Train-Test Split: Divided data (80% train, 20% test).

5) Feature Scaling: Standardized features using StandardScaler.

6) Model Training & Evaluation:

* Trained 5 models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN.

* Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

7) Hyperparameter Tuning:

* Used GridSearchCV for Random Forest.

* Used RandomizedSearchCV for SVM.

8) Feature Importance:
* Used Random Forest to visualize top contributing features.

# Project Summary

This end-to-end ML project focused on predicting a vehicle's drivetrain using structured automotive data. Among all trained models, the Random Forest Classifier performed best, achieving strong results in terms of F1-score and general classification metrics.

ðŸ”‘ Key predictive features included:

* Price
* Engine type
* Fuel type
* Mileage
* Transmission

This solution can be beneficial to automotive marketplaces or dealerships for:

* Enhancing vehicle recommendation systems
* Optimizing inventory filtering
* Understanding customer preferences related to drivetrain options
